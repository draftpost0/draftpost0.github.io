# PROSE
### *SLITHER MAG 202* (2020) 
- short 'multi-author' microfiction anthology about 20xx life and the working for exposure racket. marks the beginning (only the beginning) of experimentation with the written form. visual experimentation hadn't occurred to me yet, or at least it wasn't in the brief, so it looks fairly standard. the voices are all fairly similar, i suppose, but i'd say writing a specific generation is the point.

not all that into writing prose but getting rejected by the pie-in-the-sky magazines i like tends to give my life wretched purpose, so more soon, i suppose.

# POEMS
### *LZ X TLC* (2021) 
- AI-assisted mashup poetry pamphlet. a zine(?) exploring my own development as a writer at this time, sort of a time capsule. made in ms publisher eventually because i thought that would be easier (it wasn't). i'm told it needs 'a framework to anchor the reader', but also that it's 'dazzling' and 'highly original': as soon as i know how to square these two positions, or what 'framework to anchor the reader' actually means, you'll be the first to know. 
<br>
<br>
i don't think this is conveniently screen-readable because of how it was made, but if you know how to make that work without doing something stupid like 'take screenshots of each page', get in touch. i would appreciate help with it.

### *LIKE SOMETHING ELSE, NERDS.* (2021)
- some other 20xx pamphlet. taking cut-ups and applying them to topics. it's very visual. definitely not a time capsule. it's looking likely that bits of it will be out in a poetry press annual in december. if you're here from that, hello. 
<br>
<br>
this should be screen-readable: i made it mostly in photoshop so writing alt-text was easier. i don't have a way of testing it, though. again, get in touch if i've done it wrong and you know how to fix it.

# OTHER
### *SUPER POPULAR* (2021) 
- twine prose + poem stream of consciousness thing about a trapped 20xx trans woman. i'm told there's 'humour', 'surreality' and 'angst' in it. it's kind of broken because twine is a piece of shit so remaking it is high on my to do list, but it's all about working out how to automate the sentence code so i don't end up having to time each one. oh, and i should let the player progress the pages when i do remake it. right now, though, it's playable enough, good apparently, and writing for video games is something i really want to do so it's useful to stick this in even though it's more 'interactive story' than 'game'. roll up.

current interest: trying to work out my current interest. there's only so much realism you can take before cutting off the oxygen supply to your own brain. keep coming up with good ideas then realising hard-hitting clinical depression is not a side effect of comedy and i shouldn't do it. so right now what all this is is an isolated experiment. whatever else i do needs a reason to exist. all of this is influenced by seeing a tweet in the last five minutes, by the way. burn the portfolio down.

i want to and have written a variety of different things  stage plays and animated / live action tv scripts and sitcoms and sketch shows and operas and whatever else it is that i haven't attempted yet. most of these other projects are either driving me mad out of perfectionism or carrots dangled by a production company saying they can get them made so i don't want to mess that up posting them online. the entertainment industry is fucking stupid. let's just say 'scripts' are also something i can do, and if you want to see these i can show you them.

the longer something iâ€™ve written is, the harder i find assessing its quality. i look good in shorts.

it would obviously be very nice to be commissioned or employed via e-mail but i will settle for being contacted by like-minded people with nice things to say.

if you are commissioning me, generally if i write something it's because i'm interested in an idea, the money is good, or i'm being held at knifepoint. choose carefully.

**thank you.**
