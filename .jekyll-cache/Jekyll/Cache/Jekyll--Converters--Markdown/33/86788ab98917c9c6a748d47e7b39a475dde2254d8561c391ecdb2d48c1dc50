  <li>â€˜multi-authorâ€™ flash fiction anthology about 20xx life and the working for exposure racket. marks the beginning (only the beginning) of experimentation with the written form. visual experimentation hadnâ€™t occurred to me yet, or at least it wasnâ€™t in the brief, so it looks fairly standard. the voices are all fairly similar, i suppose, but iâ€™d say writing a specific generation is the point.
<br />
<br />
i donâ€™t do a lot of prose these days, bit dull and boring innit, canâ€™t figure out any creative interesting angle on it. bear with me.

  <li>AI-assisted mashup poetry pamphlet. a zine(?) exploring my own development as a writer at this time, sort of a time capsule. made in ms publisher eventually because i thought that would be easier (it wasnâ€™t). iâ€™m told it needs â€˜a framework to anchor the readerâ€™, but also that itâ€™s â€˜dazzlingâ€™ and â€˜highly originalâ€™: as soon as i know how to square these two positions, or what â€˜framework to anchor the readerâ€™ actually means, youâ€™ll be the first to know.

  <li>some other 20xx pamphlet just about finished. the art (â€˜artâ€™) took time to work up for each one. a poem from it or at least indicative of it is going to be in a small digital magazine soon, under my secret identity because itâ€™s quite awkward actually to submit under a pseudonym you havenâ€™t even got. i need to work that out. itâ€™s also looking likely that bits of it will be out in a poetry press annual in december. if youâ€™re here from that, hi.

  </li>
  <li>twine prose + poem stream of consciousness thing about a trapped 20xx trans woman. iâ€™m told thereâ€™s â€˜humourâ€™, â€˜surrealityâ€™ and â€˜angstâ€™. itâ€™s kind of broken because twine is a piece of shit so remaking it is high on my to do list, but itâ€™s playable enough, good apparently, and writing for video games is something i want to do so itâ€™s useful to stick this in even though itâ€™s more â€˜interactive storyâ€™ than â€˜gameâ€™. roll up.
<br />
<br />
trying to write stage plays and animated / live action tv scripts and sitcoms but theyâ€™re not good. bulk of what i have is from pyrotechnics era and what isnâ€™t is either not the standard i want to achieve or a dangled carrot by a production company saying they can get them made so i donâ€™t want to fuck that up posting them online. letâ€™s say iâ€™m working on all that. the entertainment industry is stupid. i drift away in hope. never journalism. fuck that.
<br /></li>

<hr />
<p>current interest: a short story and a novel, maybe, a bit more removed from reality or at least within an actual definable genre. thereâ€™s only so much realism you can take before cutting off the oxygen supply to your own brain. keep coming up with good ideas then realising hard-hitting clinical depression is not a side effect of comedy and i shouldnâ€™t do it. so right now what all this is is an isolated experiment. all of this is influenced by seeing a tweet in the last five minutes, by the way. burn the portfolio down.</p>

<p>kicking about an idea for a tv series but iâ€™m well over the sheer effort it takes to come up with three to six hours of television only to receive negligible interest. you canâ€™t really publish or broadcast pyrotechnics can you. canâ€™t really post the scripts i have written right now as theyâ€™re either not good or in dev hell somewhere.</p>

<p>it would obviously be very nice to be commissioned to do whimsy via e-mail but i will settle for being contacted by like-minded people with nice things to say.</p>

<p><strong>thank you.</strong></p>
